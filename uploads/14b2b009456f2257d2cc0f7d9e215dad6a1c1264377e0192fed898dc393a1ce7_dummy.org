  Need to write user story for Debbie in Jira



:USER_STORY:

SO: ????

Component: Gx Program

Priority: ????
-----------------------------------------------------------
As a system, I want to calculate the compliance metric GPR based on the following hierarchy.
- Invoice GCN
- OS Main GCN
- WAC
- AWP

With this feature, items (NDCs) within the same GCN will be extended with the same price and thus reducing the confusion on reports and communications.

If feature is successfully implemented, 
- items (NDCs) under the same GCN with varying "invoiced" price-per-unit will have consistent price of "invoiced" GCN (a).
- items (NDCs) under the same GCN with varying "OneStop Main" price-per-unit will have consistent price of "OneStop Main" GCN (b)

(a) Invoiced GCN is calculated by on weighted average of all NDCs across GCN.

(b) OneStop Main GCN is calculated by simple average of all NDCs across GCN.

  I looked at the BPR processing of this customer.  And the transactions had become very irregular (no steady dispense or sales).   Essentially, during the month of April â€“ Jun, the customer had not purchased anything from McKesson thus leading to irregular BPR.  
  
  This type of dip in BPR or GPR is usually caused by lack of transactions for long period of time.  Additionally, BPR dips into negative region due to high return.  GPR/BPR works well and quite forgiving in terms of irregular transaction pattern but with long period of inactivity, the trend usually looks like sudden drop.  
  
  In conclusion, It is not something that is caused by McKesson SLA or our miscalculation.  
  
  Month	Sales	Dispense	Notes

  Mar 2017	719.70	719.70

  May 2017	0	-465.60

  The classification process rely on two separate sources of referential data

  1) MasterData (If product is carried by McKesson)

  2) FDB (If product is not carried by McKesson)

     - Fields inside FDB used to classify an items

       A) GNRC_IND  (Flag to identify if the drug maybe generics)

       B) GNRC_MANUFACTURER_IND (Flag to identify if the manufacturer may manufacture generics)

       C) GNRC_NAMED_DRUG_IND (Flag to identify if the item may be a named generics drug)

  

     These are existing logic that were in place for GPR/BPR program.

     However, from the investigation, B) seems to cause the inconsistent classification in recent issues.

     Although we may need to make sure that changing the criteria will not impact the "currently correctly classified" items

  Steps
  1) [X] Get all NDCs in the system
  2) [X] Classify with IW/FDB
  3) [X] Load FDA data
  4) [ ] Classify FDB with ANDA
  5) [ ] Load 3rd party data
  6) [ ] Classify with 3rd party sources
  7) [ ] Classify using normal approach [1/1/1]
- Note taken on [2017-10-17 Tue 10:39] \\
  Logic
  - Pull data from web
  - Pull data from FDA
  - Hierarchy of classification
    IW
    Drug Application filing
    3rd Party data
    Original approach
